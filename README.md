# "Grid Chaser"

Search the WSJT-X log `ALL.TXT`, which is updated live, for certain
states or grid squaress.

For a ham radio digital mode called FT8, sometimes I want to watch for
a person in a certain state or at certain grid coordinates. The
software WSJT-X highlights "CQ" calls based on grids and countries,
but it doesn't highlight the messages of stations talking to each
other in the midst of a contact.
